Please note that this package is mostly useful for people using pgadmin3
package. We mention here the part of the copyright which apply to the
PostgreSQL documentation distributed as an enhancement to pgAdmin III.

pgAdmin III was downloaded from http://www.pgadmin.org/

On Debian GNU/Linux systems, you can find the full copyright for pgAdmin III
in /usr/share/doc/pgadmin3/copyright.

The following copyright applies to the PostgreSQL documentation distributed
with pgAdmin III. Note that although the PostgreSQL website reports it is
distributed under the BSD licence, I quote the entire text as it is not
exactly the one you can find in /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD on Debian
GNU/Linux systems.
