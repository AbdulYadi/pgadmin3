pgadmin3 (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

pgadmin3 (1.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-built on current libwxgtk2.6. (Closes: #366195)
  * Package split. pgagent is now distributed as a separated package so that
    people can benefit from it on PostgreSQL servers without installing all
    the pgAdmin III stuff.
    [debian/control,debian/{pgadmin3,pgagent}.install]
    [debian/{pgadmin3,pgagent}.manpages]
  * Now pgadmin3 package recommends pgagent. [debian/control]
  * Applied patch from Dave Page to solve crash issue when decrementing server
    status refresh rate. Svn rev 5236 from REL-1_4_0_PATCHES.
    (Closes: #373638)

pgadmin3 (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream includes a fix for GCC 4.1 build problems. (Closes: #358298)

    able to get it included upstream in time (more information in #341117).

pgadmin3 (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Merged patch from 1.2.2-1.1 by Loic Minier and added its changelog entry.
    (Closes: #341117)
  * Removed libssl-dev from build-dep as libpq-dev already depends on it.
    [debian/control]
  * Removed circular dependency between pgadmin3 and pgadmin3-data:
    - Replaced "Depends" with "Enhances" for pgadmin3-data. [debian/control]
    - Made a real doc directory for pgadmin3-data because we break the
      circular dependency: removed debian/pgadmin3-data.links.
      (Closes: #339900)
  * Added pgagent manpage. [debian/pgadmin3.manpages]
  * dh_installdocs is back to debian/rules as we need a separate copyright
    directory for pgadmin3-data since we broke the circular dependency.
    - Also renamed debian/copyright to debian/pgadmin3.copyright and added
      debian/pgadmin3-data.copyright.
    - Also enabled dh_installchangelogs in binary-indep target.
      [debian/rules]

pgadmin3 (1.4.0-0.2.beta1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Final merge between Tomasz Rybak work and official 1.2.2 packaging stuff
    we should be ready to build 1.4.0 beta1...
    - removed "hints" entry from menu file as done in 1.2.2-1
    [debian/pgadmin3.menu]
    - moved to policy version 3.6.2 instead of 3.6.1 as done 1.2.2-1.
    [debian/control]
    - kept ui to i18n relocation from Tomasz. [debian/rules]
    [debian/pgadmin3.install]
    - backed out CPPFLAGS hack from Tomasz and reverted to what was done in
    1.2.2. That old "-I ./include" should definitely be rechecked.
    [debian/rules]
    - kept pgagent installation although there is currently no manpage for it.
    [debian/pgadmin3.install]
    - corrected package version number (used something lower than 1).
    [debian/changelog]
  * Thanks Tomasz for your help.

pgadmin3 (1.0.2-0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Kept Andreas Tille's idea to remove wxWidgets at the end of the build but
    invoked $(doPgA3Wx)-clean target instead of using "rm -r" on an hardcoded
    directory
  * Fixed a typo concerning locales installation in /usr/share/locale and added
    LC_MESSAGES directory to the install destination
  * Moved back "doc" files to /usr/share/pgadmin3/docs as they are required by
    pgadmin3 in order to run properly (debian-policy 12.3.)

    generated twice. (Passed DH_OPTIONS=-i to indep and -a to arch).
  * Added patch from Andreas Pflug to wxWidgets to prevent pgAdmin3 help system
    crash (AP patch posted to wx patches as 854137)
  * Renamed pgadmin3-doc to pgadmin3-data as this is not a pure documentation
    package

    the complete license in debian/copyright.
  * Split into binary and doc package
