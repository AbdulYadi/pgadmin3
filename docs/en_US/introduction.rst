Introduction
************

pgAdmin III is a comprehensive `PostgreSQL database <http://www.postgresql.org>`_
design and management system for Unix and Windows systems. It is freely
available under the terms of the :ref:`licence` and may
be redistributed provided the terms of the licence are adhered to. The project
is managed by the :ref:`team`.

This software was written as a successor to the original pgAdmin and pgAdmin II
products, which though popular, had limitations in the design that prevented
them being taken to the 'next level'. pgAdmin III is written in C++ and uses
the excellent `wxWidgets <http://www.wxwidgets.org>`_ (formerly wxWindows)
cross platform toolkit. Connection to PostgreSQL is made using the
native libpq library.
