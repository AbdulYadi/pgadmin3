$SELECTION$. Upon macro execution, the placeholder will be replaced with
the currently selected text in the SQL pane of the Query Tool.

To create a macro, select the Manage Macros option from the Macros menu
on the Query Tool. Select the key you wish to use, enter the name of the macro,
and the query, optionally including the selection placeholder, and then click 
the Save button to store the macro.

To clear a macro, select the macro on the Manage Macros dialogue, and then
click the Clear button.

To execute a macro, simply press the appropriate shortcut keys, or select
it from the Macros menu.
