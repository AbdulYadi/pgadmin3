Using pgAdmin III
=================

This section explains how you can use pgAdmin to maintain your PostgreSQL
databases. pgAdmin supports database server versions 7.3 and up. Versions
older than 7.3 are not supported, please use pgAdmin II for these.

When editing the properties of a database object, pgAdmin will support you with
help about the underlying PostgreSQL SQL commands, if you press the F1 function
key. In order for this to work, the SQL helpsite setting in the options dialog
must be set correctly.
