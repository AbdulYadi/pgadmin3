This directory contains scripts for building a suitable installation of 
wxWidgets for your platform to allow you to build pgAdmin.

Patches
=======

The patches sub-directory contains patches to wxWidgets that resolve known
issues to pgAdmin.

wxmac-2_8_12-font-dialogue.diff - Fixes the font selection dialogue on Mac.

GTK
===

Download wxGTK to a suitable directory and unpack it. Then run the following 
command as root:

./build-wxgtk /path/to/wxgtk

wxGTK will be built in shared and static library versions, with and without
debug symbols. it will be installed in the default location, /usr/local/

Mac
===

Download wxMAC to a suitable directory and unpack it. Then run the following
command as root:

./build-wxmac /path/to/wxmac

wxMAC will be built in shared and static library versions, with and without
debug symbols. it will be installed in the default location, /usr/local/

MSW
===

Download wxMSW to ..\..\..\pgadmin3-deps\wxWidgets

Run "build-wxmsw.bat" to from a Visual Studio 2008 commandprompt to build the 
required parts of wxWidgets in both release and debug builds (unicode, DLL).


Additional tips - VC++
----------------------

To view wxString and other objects in the VC++ debugger:

1.  Locate and open a file called AUTOEXP.DAT. Its normally in the 
    \Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Packages\Debugger under 
    Visual Studio 2008.

2.  Add the following line to the [autoexpand] section - be careful not to put
    it in the [Visualizer] section which makes up the bulk of the file!:

;-- wxWidgets Options ------------------------
wxString =<m_pchData,st>
wxPoint =x=<x> y=<y>
wxSize =w=<x> h=<y>
wxRect =x=<x> y=<y> w=<width> h=<height>
wxWindow =<,t> hWnd=<m_hWnd>
;---------------------------------------------


3. Restart Visual Studio.

To prevent the debugger stepping into trivial functions, add entries similar to
the following to AUTOEXP.DAT, in the [ExecutionControl] section (create it if
needed):


;-- wxWidgets Options ------------------------
wxString\:\:c_str.*=NoStepInto
operator new=NoStepInto
wxString\:\:wxString=NoStepInto
wxString\:\:~wxString=NoStepInto
;---------------------------------------------


Note that the function name match is a regexp, hence the escaping of the colons.

Additional tips - Xcode
-----------------------

To debug on Mac OSX, Xcode can be used in place of of plain old gdb even though
pgAdmin is not built using Xcode. Here's how:

1) Create a new, empty project in XCode.
2) Select Project->New Custom Executable...
3) Select pgAdmin3-debug.app (the debug bundle created by 
   pkg/mac/debug-bundle.sh), and set the working directory
   to the top of the source tree.
4) Debug using Debug->Debug Executable.

In order to view wxString's in the watch window, you'll need to add the 
following XML to:

~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/CustomDataViews/CustomDataViews.plist

 	<key>wxFileName</key>
 	<dict>
 		<key>ValueString</key>
 		<string>%m_name%:s.%m_ext%:s</string>
 	</dict>
 	<key>wxString</key>
 	<dict>
 		<key>SummaryString</key>
 		<string>{(char *)$VAR.mb_str( wxConvUTF8 )}:s</string>
 		<key>ValueString</key>
 		<string>len={(int)$VAR.Length()} {(char *)$VAR.mb_str( wxConvUTF8 )}:s</string>
 	</dict>
